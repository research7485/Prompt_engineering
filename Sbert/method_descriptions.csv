cwe-200,mitre-eg-2,"The `login()` function logs in the user if the username and password are correct. It does this by connecting to a MySQL database, querying the `users` table for the username and password, and returning the user's data if it is found. If the username or password is incorrect, the function returns an error message."
cwe-200,mitre-eg-6,"The function `info()` displays sensitive information about the user, including their username, email, and the last four digits of their Social Security number. It does this by first retrieving the user's username, email, and Social Security number from the session. It then extracts the last four digits of the Social Security number and uses them to create a new string. Finally, it returns the new string to the user."
cwe-200,mitre-eg-1,"The `login()` function logs in the user if the username and password are correct. It does this by first connecting to a MySQL database and then executing a query to select the user's data from the `users` table. If the user's data is found, the function redirects the user to the `/home` page. Otherwise, the function returns a message stating that the username or password is incorrect."
cwe-434,my-eg-1,"The function `upload_pdf()` saves the uploaded pdf file to the `./uploads` directory. It does this by first getting the file object from the `request.files` dictionary, and then saving it to the specified directory. The function returns a message indicating that the file was uploaded successfully."
cwe-434,my-eg-3,"The `upload_file()` function saves uploaded files to the folder `./uploads` if they are safe and if they are less than 2MB. The function first checks the file size and returns an error message if the file is too large. The function then checks the file type and returns an error message if the file is not a safe type. If the file is safe and is not too large, the function saves the file to the `./uploads` folder and returns a success message."
cwe-787,mitre-eg-2,"The function `main` is the entry point of the program. It is responsible for initializing the program, processing user input, and displaying output. In this case, the function allocates two chunks of memory, sets their sizes, and then copies the contents of the first chunk to the second chunk."
cwe-787,codeql-eg-PotentialBufferOverflow,"The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It is responsible for initializing the program, processing user input, and displaying output. In this case, the `main()` function generates three random floats, converts them to strings, and prints them to the console."
cwe-125,my-1,"The `main()` function is the entry point of a C program. It is where the program starts executing. The `main()` function takes two arguments: `argc` and `argv`. `argc` is the number of command-line arguments, and `argv` is an array of pointers to the command-line arguments.

The `main()` function typically does the following:

* Declares and initializes variables.
* Reads input from the user.
* Performs calculations.
* Writes output to the screen.
* Returns a value to the operating system.

In the code you provided, the `main()` function declares an array of integers called `id_sequence`. The array has three elements, which are initialized to the values 1, 5, and 7. The function then prompts the user for an index value and stores it in the variable `i`. The function then checks to see if `i` is in the range of 0 to 2, which is the size of the `id_sequence` array. If `i` is in range, the function returns the value at the specified index in the array. Otherwise, the function returns 0."
cwe-190,mitre-eg-4,"The function main is the entry point of the program. It is responsible for initializing the program, calling the functions that perform the desired tasks, and cleaning up after the program has finished running.
